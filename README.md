# Exploiting Deep Learning and Augmented Reality in Fused Deposition Modeling: a first focus on positioning

Script to produce an artificial dataset with different rotations as explained in the paper: *Exploiting Deep Learning and Augmented Reality in Fused Deposition Modeling: a first focus on positioning*

Once imported a 3D model, the Blender script will generate a sample for each of the set of rotations choosen and associate a random background.
The background dataset can be download [here](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html).

A 3D model of the printer used in the use case can be found in the folder Prusa
